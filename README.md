### Welcome!

This is our Group Project for the course "Programming - Introduction Level" at the University of St.Gallen by Mario Silic.

With our code "main.py" it is possible, to discover the New York Times Bestseller list from 1942 to 2013.The code does 
  1. **import and clean the text file** (you'll also find the file in the folder), 
  2. **create and execute functions**, which:
      - return bestseller titles in a particular year range, based on user input.
      - return the titles that reached #1 in a particular month and year.
      - show every entry in the list by a specific author, once again, based on user input.
      - filter the bestseller list by book title, depending on which title/key word was entered by the user.
      - return the top X publishers over the entered period of time.
  3. **initiate a simple User-Interface** which let the user decide what happens. 

The code has been created by a diverse and multicultural team, thus different techniques were applied, e.g. to filter data. This on the one hand shows, that we have been experimenting with different approaches and - as often in the real word - that there's more than one way to skin a cat. On the other hand, e.g. different output formats, provide the user with great possibilities to find his or hers individually prefered style.

#### Feel free to try the code on our repl.it:

Have fun with the code and best wishes!
